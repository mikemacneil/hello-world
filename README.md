# hello-world
This is my first github repository

I'm mainly interested in Java.  From a professional perspective, I learned Java as part of my BCS degree but I have had to focus on other areas of IT as a matter of necessity.  I now find myself havng more time to pursue personal interest.  In addition to taking online courses, I would like to explore github as a way to refresh my skills and interest in programming.
